What is AGILE ? 

What is the Problem ? / why it is born ? 

Long time ago people will using SDLC as methodology for developing a software. Then, there is a condition where business required a software for their market, but IT required long time to deliver, one blog say it is required 3 years to deliver a software. and in the time the software ready, the market/business already changes. That time business changes more faster then IT changes. Why it is taking long time to deliver ? 
    1. it is taking time to do complete gathering and planning.
    2. it is taking time due to overhead documentation. 
    3. those two makes long way from idea to delivery.


What is the solution  ? / what is the motivation ? 

Then some expert guys discussing how to solve the problems. then few ideas coming : 
    1. To more focus on Customer collaboration over contract.
    2. To more focus on Customer feedback over Plan.
    3. To more focus on Working product over documentation. 
    4. To more focus on Invidual and Collaboration over process and tools.

they name above ideas as AGILE MANIFESTO. manifesto means the intent or the spirit AGILE was introduced. 


To achieve the spirit of AGILE/AGILE Manifesto, we need the HOW/Guideline ?. and that is where 12 AGILE principles come in place. 

After we got the HOW/Guideline answer, now what is the tactics/or the real thing to do the HOW or to implement the guideline ?. that is where SCRUM, XP, Lean, etc come in place to guiding us on executing AGILE. usually knows as AGILE Methodogoly.

I also can say that SDLC have mindset to do complete and comphrehensive analysis and brainstorming software cabalities in front, then deliver as one product while agile break and deliver into smaller pieces and encourage us to taking risk then learning continously from success and failure.
